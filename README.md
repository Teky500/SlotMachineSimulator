# SlotMachineSimulator
The point of this project is to attempt to make something slightly complicated in a programming language that isn't widely used.
The programming language used is Dragon.

The program simulates a slot machine, letting the user play until either they run out of money, get too much money, or enter a button other than blank.

The winning condition is matching three on the same column, with the WILD being considered as a match for anything.

Possible improvements:
 More win conditions (matches on rows or diagonals should be considered as well).
 
 Variable bets (simply base the winnings around how much the user bet to better simulate a real slot machine).
 
 Make the winnings based on each match variable, and then calculate the odds based around these as well.
 
 Add a free spins card.
 
 Examples of current program for reference:
